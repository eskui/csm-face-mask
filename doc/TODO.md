# TODO

## Possible problems
- [x] Can camera be used on background? - Yes, it can!
- [x] Can camera be activate on unlock or keypresses? - Yes, it can!
- [x] Does YOLO (or another similar library) support images with different sizes? - We can scale the images.

## Generic stuff
- [ ] Move use cases to human-centred manner as advised in design thinking?
- [ ] Minimal documentation before the end/demo

## Open questions
- [x] Do inference on the phone or use APIs to backend server? - We'll try to do this on the phone.
- [x] Develop on home computers or somewhere else? - Seems like everyone will have their own development environment.
- [x] Should we detect from video or from static picture? - We'll use a static picture to start with.

## Mobile frontend
- [x] App that works on background and displays a 'Hello World!' notification when the phone is unlocked
- [x] App that works on background and takes an image with the front camera when the phoneis unlocked
- [x] App that takes a photo and detects images using a model pretrained on ImageNet
- [x] App that takes a photo and detects images using a model pretrained on Imagenet when the phone is unlocked
- [x] App that takes a photo and detects bounding box for the face (not needed)
- [x] App that detects from picture of a face if the face has mask on or not
- [ ] Test with another Android phone
- [ ] App that takes a photo and detects if a face is present or not
- [ ] Add buttons to notification
- [ ] Geolocation

## Software development
- [ ] Productize Android app code

## Data Science
- [x] YOLO installation instructions for Anaconda
- [x] Collect images with and without masks
- [x] Train a model for detecting if mask is on or not
- [x] Evaluate augmentation options and specify parameters
- [x] Test hyperparameters like learning rate and momentum
- [x] Scrape more data from the web (Done, Esa has over 800 pictures)
- [x] Incorporate scraped training data
- [ ] Add no-face test-images
- [ ] Train a "face or not" model (do we need?)
- [ ] Detect if a mask is correctly put on #additional functionality
