# TODO

## Possible problems
- [x] Can camera be used on background? - Yes, it can!
- [x] Can camera be activate on unlock or keypresses? - Yes, it can!
- [x] Does YOLO (or another similar library) support images with different sizes? - We can scale the images.

## Generic stuff
- [ ] Move use cases to human-centred manner as advised in design thinking?

## Open questions
- [x] Do inference on the phone or use APIs to backend server? - We'll try to do this on the phone.
- [x] Develop on home computers or somewhere else? - Seems like everyone will have their own development environment.
- [x] Should we detect from video or from static picture? - We'll use a static picture to start with.

## Mobile frontend
- [ ] How-to instructions for running the current App in Android Studio
- [x] App that works on background and displays a 'Hello World!' notification when the phone is unlocked
- [x] App that works on background and takes an image with the front camera when the phoneis unlocked
- [ ] App that takes a photo and detects digits 0-9 from it (MNIST)
- [ ] App that takes a photo and detects digits 0-9 when the phone is unlocked (Extension to previous item, could be done at the same time?)
- [ ] App that takes a photo and detects if a face is present or not
- [ ] App that takes a photo and detects bounding box for the face
- [ ] App that takes a photo and crops the face from the image using the bounding box information
- [ ] App that detects from a face, cropped from a photo, if it has mask or not
- [ ] Geolocation

## Data Science
- [x] YOLO installation instructions for Anaconda
- [x] Collect images with and without masks
- [ ] Train a "face or not" model
- [ ] Train a model that can get bounding box for face (this can possible be combined with the "face or not" model)
- [ ] Train a model for detecting if mask is on or not
